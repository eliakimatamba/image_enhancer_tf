# image_enhancer_tf


This code reads in an image file called "input.jpg",
converts it to grayscale, resizes it to fit the input size of a machine learning model,
and then converts it to a tensor. The tensor is then fed as input to the model,
which generates an enhanced image as output. The enhanced image is extracted from the output tensor and saved to a file called "output.jpg".
